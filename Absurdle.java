/**
 * Absurdle is a word guessing game where the player has to guess a word by
 * guessing the pattern of the word.
 * The player has a limited number of guesses to guess the word.
 * The game will read in a list of words from a file and randomly select a word
 * for the player to guess.
 * The player will guess the pattern of the word by guessing the correct letters
 * in the correct position.
 * The game works against the player by ensuring the patterns with the most
 * possible answers are used.
